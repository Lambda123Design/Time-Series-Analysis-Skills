## **I) Introduction and Outline**

This course provides a comprehensive guide to analyzing time series data with Python, combining both classical statistical methods and modern machine learning techniques. It begins with a foundation in time series basics, ensuring that learners new to the subject understand the types of data that qualify as time series, essential transformations, evaluation metrics, and a primer on financial time series concepts like log prices, log returns, and randomness.

In the first major section, the course introduces classic forecasting methods, including Exponential Smoothing (ETS) for handling error, trend, and seasonality, and ARIMA models for more machine learning-like approaches to time series prediction. Practical tools such as ACF, PACF, and Auto ARIMA are explored, along with vector models for analyzing interactions between multiple time-dependent variables.

The second section shifts focus to applying machine learning models to time series data. Techniques such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests are used for both forecasting and classification tasks, with examples like predicting user activity from smartphone accelerometer data. The course then advances into deep learning approaches, covering architectures like CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs, highlighting their adaptability for sequential data and surprising learners who may already be familiar with these models in other domains.

Finally, the VIP section offers exclusive advanced content. This includes Amazon Forecast for automated, state-of-the-art forecasting with minimal coding, GARCH models for modeling both prices and volatility in financial data, and Facebook’s Prophet for practical time series forecasting. Additional surprise VIP materials are promised, making the course appealing for learners seeking the latest tools and techniques.

## **II)Warmup (Optional)**

This set of warm-up exercises introduces practical coding tasks to prepare learners for time series and financial data analysis. The first task is to use NumPy to generate 1000 random samples from the standard normal distribution (mean zero, variance one). These samples are then visualized both as a time series and as a histogram. The next exercise builds on this by adding a trend line to the noise, encouraging experimentation with different parameters and plotting it as a scatterplot rather than a line chart.

A further step is to compute the cumulative sum of the noise samples and plot the result as a time series. Learners are asked to reflect on what this resembles in the context of time series analysis, hinting at concepts like random walks and financial modeling. Following this, students generate 1000 samples from a multivariate normal distribution with a specified mean vector and covariance matrix, then plot the results as a scatterplot to begin thinking about correlations and relationships between variables.

To deepen understanding, learners calculate the sample mean and sample covariance of these multivariate samples. Instead of using NumPy’s built-in mean and cov functions, they are encouraged to apply the actual formulas manually, reinforcing theoretical concepts that will be crucial later in the course.

The instructor emphasizes that these exercises are not meant to teach Python basics but to apply existing skills directly to statistical and financial problems. Mastery of NumPy, pandas, SciPy, and Matplotlib is assumed and considered essential. Learners are reminded that these prerequisites are freely available to study and highly beneficial. The philosophy is that one cannot expect to jump from learning basic coding syntax to analyzing complex financial or time series data overnight; instead, building a solid foundation is crucial for long-term success.

## **III) Time Series Basics**

**A) Time Series Basics Section Introduction**

This section introduces time series basics and a primer on finance. Many students in this course are particularly interested in time series analysis for financial applications. The section begins by answering the question: What is a time series? Although some students may have preexisting intuition about time series, a concrete definition is provided, along with multiple examples to illustrate potential applications.

Next, the concepts of modeling and predicting are discussed. While many beginners in machine learning often consider these the same, they are actually separate tasks. It is important to understand when each task is being performed and why, as there are situations where one is more relevant than the other.

The importance of understanding the “shape” of data is then addressed. This concept, often overlooked in standard courses and books, is essential for visualizing sequences and images. Being able to intuitively understand the shape of data allows for more effective analysis and interpretation.

The lecture then categorizes different types of time series tasks. These include one-step forecasts, multi-step forecasts, multi-output forecasts, and time series classification. Each approach addresses different predictive or analytical needs.

Data transformations, specifically of the Box-Cox variety, are discussed next. Time series transformations differ from typical machine learning transformations, and understanding their purpose is critical. Forecasting metrics are also introduced. Although time series analysis uses many different metrics, familiarity with them is important for reading research papers and communicating effectively with colleagues.

A Financial Time Series Primer follows, introducing key quantities in finance such as net return, gross return, log return, log prices, adjusted close, and dividends. Understanding these concepts is necessary even though financial time series resemble standard time series in structure.

Practical coding exercises include stock price simulations, providing early hands-on experience. These simulations are foundational for later theoretical discussions, including insights into the random walk and the random walk hypothesis. These concepts highlight what is possible and impossible to forecast in financial time series.

The lecture also covers the naive forecast and the importance of having a baseline model. While it may seem simple compared to advanced machine learning models, the naive forecast often serves as a surprisingly effective benchmark. Practical exercises teach how to implement and evaluate the naive forecast using the metrics previously discussed.

This section combines theory and practical work to provide a solid foundation for advanced topics in time series and financial analysis.

**B) What is a Time Series?**

This lecture begins by addressing the basic question: What is a time series? Many students may already have some intuition about time series. Examples include the price of a stock or readings from an EKG. The weather is another simple, everyday example of a time series that everyone can recognize. Time series data is clearly all around us, and one does not need to be a data scientist to understand it intuitively. For the purpose of this class, however, a more specific definition is required.

Some types of data will not be discussed in this class. One example is general sequence data. While time series is a type of sequence data, sequences can encompass much more. For instance, sentences are sequences of words, and techniques from natural language processing are used to handle them. Another example is genomics data, where sequences of letters C and G represent molecules akin to computer programs for living things. Unlike these categorical sequences, time series in this class consists of real-valued observations. It is worth noting, however, that many techniques from this course can also be applied to categorical sequences.

Irregularly spaced recordings are another example of data that will not be covered. For instance, if one checks their heart rate on an Apple Watch inconsistently, recording three times one week and two times the previous week at irregular intervals, such data is not suitable for this course. While some techniques exist for handling irregularly spaced time series, this class focuses on models for discrete-time series sampled at regularly spaced intervals. Therefore, for the purposes of this class, a time series is continuous-valued but discrete in time.

Before concluding, another kind of time series—vector time series—is introduced. Vector time series are common. For example, stock prices of multiple stocks recorded at each point in time form a vector time series. Similarly, a single stock with multiple indicators for each time point also forms a vector time series. Brain signals provide another example. Brain-machine interfaces, although sounding futuristic, already have rudimentary implementations. Neuralink, for example, has developed a minimally invasive machine that implants electrodes in the brain. The brain communicates via electrical signals between neurons, and these electrodes can read voltages from different parts of the brain, signaling various activities.

Theoretically, these signals can be decoded to read thoughts. Experiments have enabled monkeys to control a computer mouse using only their minds. Beyond reading, it is possible to write to the brain as well. Once perfected, this technology could allow humans to acquire information directly into their minds, such as reading a book or learning an instrument without physical interaction. This is an example of a vector time series, as multiple electrodes periodically read voltages, forming multiple related time-dependent observations.

**Notes:**

This lecture begins by addressing the question: What is a time series? Intuitively, examples such as stock prices, EKG readings, or weather data illustrate that time series data is present in everyday life. While intuitive understanding is helpful, a more specific definition is required for this class.

Some types of sequence data will not be discussed. Time series is one kind of sequence data, but sequences also include examples such as sentences in natural language processing or genomic sequences composed of letters C and G. Unlike these categorical sequences, time series in this class consists of real-valued observations. However, many techniques presented can also apply to categorical sequences.

Irregularly spaced recordings, such as inconsistent heart rate measurements from a wearable device, are not covered. This class focuses on discrete-time time series sampled at regularly spaced intervals. Therefore, a time series for this course is continuous-valued but discrete in time.

Vector time series are also introduced. These consist of multiple related series observed at the same points in time. Examples include collections of stock prices across multiple companies, a single stock with multiple indicators, or brain signals recorded from multiple electrodes. Brain-machine interfaces, such as Neuralink, illustrate vector time series in a futuristic context, where electrodes read voltages from different parts of the brain to detect activity. These signals, collected periodically, constitute a vector time series and have applications ranging from controlling a computer mouse with thoughts to potentially sending information to the brain.

**Summary:**

This lecture defines time series as real-valued observations sampled at regularly spaced intervals, distinguishing them from general sequence data such as text or genomic sequences. Irregularly spaced measurements are excluded, and discrete-time, continuous-valued series are the focus. The lecture also introduces vector time series, where multiple related observations are recorded simultaneously, with examples including multiple stock prices or brain signals from electrodes. Applications such as brain-machine interfaces illustrate practical uses of vector time series.

**C) Modelling vs Predicting**

This lecture discusses a somewhat subtle topic. Students who are new to machine learning can often conflate the concepts of prediction and modeling. Most beginners to machine learning understand the need to make predictions, but not so much the need to model.

So what's the difference? Prediction is exactly how it sounds. It's about making predictions or, in other words, trying to guess something which you do not know for sure. This makes intuitive sense. For example, we might want to know whether or not someone will click our ad, we want to know how high or low a stock price will go, or we want to find objects in an image. These are all examples of making predictions.

But what does it mean to model? Modeling gives a functional form to your time series. This is very important. Not only does it tell you how to make predictions, but it also gives you deeper insight into why the time series is the way it is. It helps you answer questions about your time series. For example, you can explain why a time series is mean-reverting, or you can explain why a time series will grow unbounded.

Very importantly, it can also tell you how predictable a time series is. Someone who doesn't know how to model might waste their time trying to predict something which is actually unpredictable. For example, we all know intuitively that trying to predict a coin flip would not be useful. Someone who understands how to model will realize that what they have is unpredictable and won't waste time trying to make better predictions.

In the field of time series, we might call making predictions forecasting. So time series forecasting is the act of making predictions. However, modeling would be time series analysis. In any case, this distinction is not too important for this course, but pay attention to which is which as we go through the course. Understand what you are doing and why you are doing it. Sometimes the goal is to make an accurate forecast, but sometimes the goal is to gain a better understanding of the data we're working with. Modeling is one way to help us do this.

**Summary:**

This lecture distinguishes between prediction and modeling in time series analysis. Prediction involves making guesses about unknown outcomes, such as stock prices, ad clicks, or object detection. Modeling, on the other hand, provides a functional understanding of the time series, explaining its behavior, predictability, and underlying patterns. Forecasting refers to prediction in time series, while modeling corresponds to time series analysis. Understanding the difference helps determine when the goal is accurate prediction versus gaining deeper insight into the data.
