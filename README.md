## **I) Introduction and Outline**

This course provides a comprehensive guide to analyzing time series data with Python, combining both classical statistical methods and modern machine learning techniques. It begins with a foundation in time series basics, ensuring that learners new to the subject understand the types of data that qualify as time series, essential transformations, evaluation metrics, and a primer on financial time series concepts like log prices, log returns, and randomness.

In the first major section, the course introduces classic forecasting methods, including Exponential Smoothing (ETS) for handling error, trend, and seasonality, and ARIMA models for more machine learning-like approaches to time series prediction. Practical tools such as ACF, PACF, and Auto ARIMA are explored, along with vector models for analyzing interactions between multiple time-dependent variables.

The second section shifts focus to applying machine learning models to time series data. Techniques such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests are used for both forecasting and classification tasks, with examples like predicting user activity from smartphone accelerometer data. The course then advances into deep learning approaches, covering architectures like CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs, highlighting their adaptability for sequential data and surprising learners who may already be familiar with these models in other domains.

Finally, the VIP section offers exclusive advanced content. This includes Amazon Forecast for automated, state-of-the-art forecasting with minimal coding, GARCH models for modeling both prices and volatility in financial data, and Facebook’s Prophet for practical time series forecasting. Additional surprise VIP materials are promised, making the course appealing for learners seeking the latest tools and techniques.

## **II)Warmup (Optional)**

This set of warm-up exercises introduces practical coding tasks to prepare learners for time series and financial data analysis. The first task is to use NumPy to generate 1000 random samples from the standard normal distribution (mean zero, variance one). These samples are then visualized both as a time series and as a histogram. The next exercise builds on this by adding a trend line to the noise, encouraging experimentation with different parameters and plotting it as a scatterplot rather than a line chart.

A further step is to compute the cumulative sum of the noise samples and plot the result as a time series. Learners are asked to reflect on what this resembles in the context of time series analysis, hinting at concepts like random walks and financial modeling. Following this, students generate 1000 samples from a multivariate normal distribution with a specified mean vector and covariance matrix, then plot the results as a scatterplot to begin thinking about correlations and relationships between variables.

To deepen understanding, learners calculate the sample mean and sample covariance of these multivariate samples. Instead of using NumPy’s built-in mean and cov functions, they are encouraged to apply the actual formulas manually, reinforcing theoretical concepts that will be crucial later in the course.

The instructor emphasizes that these exercises are not meant to teach Python basics but to apply existing skills directly to statistical and financial problems. Mastery of NumPy, pandas, SciPy, and Matplotlib is assumed and considered essential. Learners are reminded that these prerequisites are freely available to study and highly beneficial. The philosophy is that one cannot expect to jump from learning basic coding syntax to analyzing complex financial or time series data overnight; instead, building a solid foundation is crucial for long-term success.

## **III) Time Series Basics**

**A) Time Series Basics Section Introduction**

This section covers time series basics and a primer on finance, with a focus on financial applications. The first topic addresses the question: What is a time series? Although some students may have preexisting intuition about time series, a concrete definition is provided, along with multiple examples to illustrate potential applications.

The next topic distinguishes between modeling and predicting. While these concepts are often thought to be the same, they are actually separate tasks. It is important to identify when each task is being performed and understand its purpose.

The concept of data “shape” is introduced, which is critical for visualization and analysis. Understanding the inherent shape of data allows for intuitive interpretation and is particularly useful in courses involving images and sequences.

Time series tasks are then categorized. These include one-step forecasts, multi-step forecasts, multi-output forecasts, and time series classification. Each approach addresses different predictive needs and applications.

Data transformations, specifically Box-Cox transformations, are discussed. Time series transformations differ from regular machine learning transformations, and understanding their purpose is essential.

Forecasting metrics are also covered. Time series analysis involves numerous metrics, and familiarity with them is necessary for understanding research papers and effective communication.

A Financial Time Series Primer introduces key quantities in finance, including net return, gross return, log return, log prices, adjusted close, and dividends. Understanding these terms is critical for financial time series analysis.

Practical coding exercises include stock price simulations, providing early hands-on experience. These simulations serve as a foundation for further theoretical exploration. The random walk and random walk hypothesis are then introduced, illustrating what is possible and impossible to forecast in time series and finance.

The naive forecast is presented as a baseline model. Although it may appear simple compared to advanced machine learning models, it often provides surprisingly effective results. Practical implementation and evaluation of the naive forecast using appropriate metrics are demonstrated.

This section combines theory and practice to establish a strong foundation for more advanced time series and financial analysis topics.

**Summary:**

This section introduces the fundamentals of time series analysis with a focus on financial applications. We begin by defining what a time series is, reinforced with examples to illustrate its practical applications. Next, we clarify the distinction between modeling and predicting, emphasizing the importance of knowing when to perform each task.

We then explore the significance of understanding the “shape” of data, a concept often overlooked in standard courses but crucial for visualizing images and sequences. The section covers different types of time series tasks, including one-step, multi-step, multi-output forecasts, and time series classification. We also discuss data transformations, particularly Box-Cox transformations, highlighting their unique role in time series analysis.

Forecasting metrics are introduced to help interpret papers and communicate effectively with colleagues. A Financial Time Series Primer follows, covering key concepts such as net return, gross return, log return, log prices, adjusted close, and dividends, which are essential for financial applications.

Practical coding exercises begin with stock price simulations to build early hands-on experience. These simulations lead into theoretical insights on the random walk and the random walk hypothesis, providing understanding of what is possible to forecast.

We then introduce the naive forecast as a baseline model, discussing its practical importance and showing how to implement and evaluate it using the metrics covered earlier.

This section balances theory with practical exercises, setting the foundation for advanced topics later in the course.

**B) What is a Time Series?**

This lecture begins by addressing the question: What is a time series? Intuitively, examples such as stock prices, EKG readings, or weather data illustrate that time series data is present in everyday life. While intuitive understanding is helpful, a more specific definition is required for this class.

Some types of sequence data will not be discussed. Time series is one kind of sequence data, but sequences also include examples such as sentences in natural language processing or genomic sequences composed of letters C and G. Unlike these categorical sequences, time series in this class consists of real-valued observations. However, many techniques presented can also apply to categorical sequences.

Irregularly spaced recordings, such as inconsistent heart rate measurements from a wearable device, are not covered. This class focuses on discrete-time time series sampled at regularly spaced intervals. Therefore, a time series for this course is continuous-valued but discrete in time.

Vector time series are also introduced. These consist of multiple related series observed at the same points in time. Examples include collections of stock prices across multiple companies, a single stock with multiple indicators, or brain signals recorded from multiple electrodes. Brain-machine interfaces, such as Neuralink, illustrate vector time series in a futuristic context, where electrodes read voltages from different parts of the brain to detect activity. These signals, collected periodically, constitute a vector time series and have applications ranging from controlling a computer mouse with thoughts to potentially sending information to the brain.

**Summary:**

This lecture defines time series as real-valued observations sampled at regularly spaced intervals, distinguishing them from general sequence data such as text or genomic sequences. Irregularly spaced measurements are excluded, and discrete-time, continuous-valued series are the focus. The lecture also introduces vector time series, where multiple related observations are recorded simultaneously, with examples including multiple stock prices or brain signals from electrodes. Applications such as brain-machine interfaces illustrate practical uses of vector time series.
